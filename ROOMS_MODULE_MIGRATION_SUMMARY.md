# Rooms Module Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated all room-related functionality from the root-level `rooms.py` file to the events module as `modules/events/events_room.py`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New File in Events Module
- `api_service/modules/events/events_room.py` - Contains all room functionality

### 2. Moved Components

#### Models (modules/events/events_room.py)
- `Room` - Room model with id and room_name
- `RoomCreate` - Model for creating new rooms

#### Database Class (modules/events/events_room.py)
- `RoomDatabase` class with all CRUD operations
- `room_db` singleton instance
- All helper methods for table reflection and database operations

### 3. Updated Imports

#### modules/events/__init__.py
- Added import for `room_db`, `RoomDatabase`, `Room`, `RoomCreate` from `.events_room`
- Added room exports to `__all__` list

#### main.py
- Removed `from models import Room, RoomCreate`
- Added `Room, RoomCreate` to the events module import
- Removed `from rooms import room_db`
- Added `room_db` to the events module import

#### models.py
- Removed Room and RoomCreate models (moved to events module)
- Updated comments to reflect new model locations

#### deployment/load_rooms.py
- Updated `from models import RoomCreate` to `from modules.events import RoomCreate`

### 4. Preserved Functionality
- All room API endpoints remain accessible (no endpoint changes)
- All database operations and business logic preserved
- Room functionality is now part of the events module (logical grouping)
- Tenant routing continues to work as before

## API Endpoints (Unchanged)
Room endpoints remain in main.py under the tenant-specific prefix:
- `GET /{tenant_name}/api/rooms` - List all rooms (manager only)
- `GET /{tenant_name}/api/rooms/public` - List all rooms (public access)
- `POST /{tenant_name}/api/rooms` - Create room (manager only)
- `DELETE /{tenant_name}/api/rooms/{room_id}` - Delete room (manager only)

## Benefits
1. **Logical Grouping**: Rooms are now part of the events module since they're primarily used for events
2. **Better Organization**: Related event and room functionality is grouped together
3. **Consistent Module Structure**: Follows the same pattern as other modules
4. **Cleaner Root Directory**: Fewer files in the main api_service directory
5. **Easier Maintenance**: Room functionality is now in a dedicated module

## Files Ready for Cleanup
- `api_service/rooms.py` - Can be safely deleted as all functionality has been moved

## Testing Required
- Verify all room endpoints work correctly after the migration
- Test that room creation/deletion still works properly
- Confirm that imports are working correctly across all modules
- Validate that no broken imports remain

## Notes
- All existing API functionality is preserved
- No breaking changes to the API interface
- Room models and database operations remain unchanged
- The migration maintains backward compatibility for all existing clients
